This is a simple TO-DO list program. It can add/remove/view the tasks to be done. It is a very simple and easy to understand Python program yet a great way
to understand the Python language and the programming logic for the beginners.
I have attached both the .py and .txt files to test out the function. 
Note: This code will work not only for 'tasks.txt' file but for any txt file in general as it takes the file name from the user input.
